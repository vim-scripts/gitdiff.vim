This script provides two functions to display git diffs in vim.

:GITDiff [commitish]

    Split the vim window vertically, display the HEAD, or some other changeset, version of the file in the split, then diff them.

:GITChanges [commitish]

    Highlight lines that were changed since the HEAD or some other changeset.

Some examples:

:GITDiff HEAD~10
:diffoff

:GITChanges origin/master
:syntax on
